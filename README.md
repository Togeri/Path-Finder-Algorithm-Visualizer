# Path-Finder-Algorithm-Visualizer

This is a humble attempt to create and visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work.

**You can access the app by clicking [here](https://togeri.github.io/Path-Finder-Algorithm-Visualizer/)**


## How it works

The Start Node is pictured as a green circle, whereas the End Node is pictured as a red star. 
You can move (drag and drop) both nodes throughout the map (grid). 

Also, you can add and remove Wall Nodes than will represent locations the algorithm can't go through. 

You can Generate a Maze Randomly.

You can download a Maze and/or upload your own maze design. The allowed format to do so is .txt

Available Pathfinding Algorithms right now are DFS and BFS. Choose your algorithm and click on "Run X Pathfinder!" to visualize the algorithm in progress.

Pending Algorithm to be implemented: Dijkstra's
