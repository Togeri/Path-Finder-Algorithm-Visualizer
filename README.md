# Path-Finder-Algorithm-Visualizer

This is a humble attempt to create and visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work.

Quick Note: At the moment, the best way you can play around with it is to set up a localhost on your local machine and access the host's address.

A quick way to do so:

1. Install Python
2. Run the following command: ***python3 -m http.server*** 
3. Access the mounted server address on your web browser (by default, it should be ***localhost:8000***)
