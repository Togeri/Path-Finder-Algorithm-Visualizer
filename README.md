# Path-Finder-Algorithm-Visualizer

This is a humble attempt to create and visualize how different pathfinding algorithms work.

**You can access the app by clicking [here](https://togeri.github.io/Path-Finder-Algorithm-Visualizer/)**

## How it Works

There are several Pathfinding Algorithms implemented in the app. You can set a situation, choose an algorithm and visualize how it gets solved and find a path from the start node to the end node, if there's any path available.

## Instructions

The `Start Node` is pictured as a green circle, whereas the `End Node` is pictured as a red star. 
You can move (drag and drop) both nodes throughout the map (grid). 

Also, you can add and remove `Wall Nodes` than will represent locations the algorithm can't go through. 

You can `Generate a Maze` Randomly.

You can `download a Maze` and/or upload your own maze design. The allowed format to do so is `.txt`

Available Pathfinding Algorithms right now are **[DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)** and **[BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)**. Choose your algorithm and click on "`Run X Pathfinder!`" to visualize the algorithm in progress.

Pending Algorithm to be implemented: `Dijkstra's`
